WordPress Publisher is a structured affiliate marketing content system that transforms random content creation into a six-stage growth strategy. Each stage has distinct goals, custom Claude AI prompts, and progressive word count targets (1500–3000+ words).
The system guides you from foundational pillar content (Stage 1) through conversion-focused reviews (Stage 2), problem-solving articles (Stage 3), thought leadership (Stage 4), niche expansion (Stage 5), to premium brand-building assets (Stage 6).

Key features include:
Interactive UI with visual progress tracking and automatic parameter adjustments
Stage-specific formatting: early stages get tables of contents, internal linking, and product comparison tables
Advanced stages add email capture forms, premium content teasers, and community engagement prompts
Intelligent completion indicators that recommend next steps based on your progress

Built on WordPress with Claude AI integration and custom JS/PHP, the system provides strategic SEO optimization at each level.
You start by building 8–10 comprehensive pillar posts, progress to 15+ revenue-generating reviews, then scale through authority-building and brand development stages—creating a clear roadmap from foundation to market leadership.
